	<p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Rambilas Sharma</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
      was born on 25th July 1950 in Rathiwas Jaton ki Dhani which lies in the 
      Rajawas Panchayat, a small village near Mahendergarh, in the family of Pandit 
      Shri Jairam and Smt. Gindodi Devi. Born in a farmer’s family with 8 siblings 
      (6 sisters & 2 brothers) he had faced several challenges in his childhood 
      but never compromised on his education. He completed his primary education 
      from the Government primary schools in Balana. Then he got admitted at Khtodada 
      for 6th standard before moving to Madhogarh for completing his remaining 
      school education. Braving all the odds Rambilas Sharma used to cross 9Km 
      long mountains to reach to school and in secondary he proudly held first 
      position in his class. After completing his higher secondary education from 
      Madhogarh School in 1967, he chose Arts stream for graduation from Rajkiya 
      Mahavidyalaya, Mahendergarh. During this period he was introduced to RSS’s 
      initiatives and influenced by the Sangh, he underwent for the first year 
      training of RSS and set up a shakha at Saatroad, Hisar while working as 
      a vistarak. To meet his daily expenses he worked at Model Town Petrol Pump 
      of Lala Banwari Lal Durga Singh. Immediately after completing his graduation 
      in 1970, in order to fulfill his father’s wish, he married Smt. Bimala Devi 
      on 15th June 1970. But he did not let his marriage change his commitment 
      levels towards Sangh’s work. On 29th June 1970 he left for Sangh Sikhsa 
      Varg, Rohtak. There he came in touch with Shri Guruji shri Madhav Sada Shiv 
      Golwalkar and in his presence Rambilas Sharma became a Pracharak and then 
      left for Jhajjar. At Jhajjar-Bahadurgarh he continue working as a Sangh 
      Pracharak. In 1971, Shri Sohan Singh ji handed the responsibilities at Sangh’s 
      Jhandelwalan branch to Rambilas Sharma, wherein he had joined as a proofreader 
      for the English daily ‘Motherland’. Concurrently he pursued his post-graduation, 
      M.A. in English by attending evening classes at the MMH College, Ghaziabad 
      from 1971-73).While pursuing his B.Ed degree from Kirodimal College at Bhiwani 
      (1973-74) he had to face several challenges to meet his education & routine 
      expenses and even had worked as a night watchman. At that time he was chosen 
      asa ‘Pracharak’ by the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS) for its Jhajjhar 
      unit. In 1974 he had joined the famous J.P.Movement. Impressed by his dedication, 
      Late Dr. Mangal Sen, requested him quit his job as a professor in Kurukshetra 
      and brought him along to Rohtak where he was appointed as General Secretary 
      of the RSS. With this event he entered into politics arena & remained actively 
      involved. Being an extraordinary activist he had joined and led several 
      movements due to which he had to go to jail on numerous occasions, where 
      he faced inhuman treatment & was tortured throughout his stay. In his political 
      career Prof. Ram Bilas Sharma has been elected as the MLA from Mahendergarh 
      area four times in a row and hasadroitly managed the protfolios as the Public 
      Health Minister & Education Minister in separate stints. While in office 
      he was credited for rolling out numerous schemes for the development of 
      Mahendergarh and played a pivotal role in melioration of this area. During 
      his political journey he attained popularity very swiftly, not only in Mahendergarh 
      but in the entire state, due to his amicable, accommodating & understanding 
      nature, eloquent oration and integrity in every action. Due to his in-depth 
      knowledge of politics a nd the organization, he held important positions 
      in the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). The party trusted him with various important 
      responsibilities, which he met diligently by building its goodwill and adding 
      to its supporter base. He was rewarded for the 4bhurasta mandr 0 years of 
      dedication to the party by being elected as BJP’s state president for the 
      second time in 2013 (earlier 1990-1993). Currently, under his leadership 
      BJP had won 7 out of 8 contested seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections and 
      have led his party to scale new heights. He has been well received by all 
      quarters of the society throughout his journey and knowing every worker, 
      pracharak, supporter by their name makes him unique. Despite of holding 
      such senior positions throughout his career he has been easily approachable 
      and his humility, readiness to help everyone at the drop of hat has enhanced 
      his popularity by many folds. He is also an avid devotee of Lord Shiva and 
      had restored an ancient temple of Baba Bhuraasta which was discovered during 
      an excavation activity in Rathivaas. He had also made over 17 ‘Kanvad Yatras’on 
      his feet to Haridwar to seek Lord Shiva’s blessings and organized numerous 
      religious functions in the region. </font></strong></p>
	  
    <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Family:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> He and 
      his family had made abundant sacrifices to support him in his political 
      journey. His wife, Smt. Bimla Devi was his pillar of strength who supported 
      her through thick & thin and also took care his family when he was away 
      to develop a better future for Haryana. He is blessed with three daughters- 
      Dr. Asha Sharma, Smt. Poonam Sharma, Dr. Annapurna Sharma &son Shri Gautam 
      Sharma. Even after achieving success at national level politics, he remains 
      grounded and prefers to stay at his native place in Rathivaas and lead a 
      commoner’s life, which makes him a people’s man.</font></strong></p>
