	  <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Food Security</font></strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">India ranks 94<sup>th</sup> out 
        of 199 countries in the Global Hunger Index. The shame of chronic hunger 
        and deprivation of food constitutes a damning indictment of the polices 
        pursued by the UPA government and the earlier NDA regime. Both have steadfastly 
        refused to introduce a universal public distribution system as it goes 
        against the World Bank and market prescriptions. The Food Security law 
        enacted by parliament is cited as a major step towards food security. 
        This is not true. It continues with a targeted system. It provides for 
        only 5 kg per individual per month. In urban areas 50 per cent of the 
        people are excluded. The CPI(M) and the Left have consistently fought 
        for a universal public Distribution System. We need to provide a minimum 
        of 35 kg of foodgrains to all families at not more than Rs. 2 per kg. 
        The citizen’s basic right to food has to be ensured.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Corruption &amp; Mega Scams</strong></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">The last one decade of UPA rule 
        has set an unprecedented record for corruption with one mega scam after 
        the other from the 2G spectrum to the coal allocation and the KG basin 
        gas pricing. The government’s neo-liberal policies has spawned a nexus 
        of big business-ruling politician-bureaucrats.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">CAG has estimated that the 2G telecom 
        has cost the exchequer Rs. 1.76 lakh crore while the coal scam around 
        Rs. 1.86 lakh crore. The KG basin gas deal and the earlier concessions 
        to Reliance for increased gas price had led to a loss of around Rs. 100,000 
        crore to the government. The current revision proposed by the government, 
        is twice this amount. The Commonwealth Games scam was worth around Rs. 
        60,000 crore.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">Contrary to the claim that privatization 
        and free market reduce corruption, evidence shows that the “black economy” 
        and the propagation of corruption has expanded under such policies, and 
        is now almost 50 per cent of the GDP of the country. (Global Financial 
        Integrity, 2010)</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">Resources that belong to the people 
        are being looted through a range of corrupt practices. Illegal flows to 
        tax havens and offshore accounts have grown rapidly along with black money; 
        the post-reform annual flows are five times the pre-reform flows. The 
        total accumulated capital and assets held by Indians abroad is estimated 
        to be in the range of half a trillion dollars (Rs. 25 lakh crore) to 1.4 
        trillion dollars (Rs. 70 lakh crores).</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">The outrage among the people and 
        the protest against corruption finally compelled the UPA government to 
        bring an amended Lokpal legislation which was adopted in parliament. However, 
        the Lokpal Act needs to bring within its purview the PPP projects and 
        the contracts given out to corporates involving public funds. More importantly, 
        the big business-politician-bureaucrat nexus spawned by the neo-liberal 
        regime needs to be broken. The CPI(M) calls for the reversal of the neo-liberal 
        policies which have spawned such a nexus.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Foreign Policy: Tilt to 
        the US</strong></font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">The decade long UPA government 
        has shifted the course of foreign policy towards a pro-US orientation. 
        In the first term, it surrendered the independent basis of foreign policy 
        by entering into a strategic alliance with the United States of America, 
        military cooperation and signing the Indo-US nuclear deal. The consequence 
        of these steps have unfolded in its second term.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">India acted against its own interests 
        by curtailing its relations with Iran. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline 
        was scuttled at the behest of America. India drastically cut down oil 
        imports from Iran to conform to the illegal US sanctions. India adopted 
        an ambivalent stand on Syria and refused to condemn the Western backed 
        forces to instigate a civil war and destabilize the Syrian government. 
        India has strengthened its military and security ties with Israel and 
        consequently downgraded its support to the Palestinian cause. The UPA 
        government has joined a India-Japan-US trilateral security relationship 
        – a US sponsored move to counter China.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">India has not utilised its weight 
        in the BRICS, IBSA and the multilateral forms to strengthen South-South 
        cooperation and multipolarity.</font></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><font color="#FFFFFF">The foreign policy stance of both 
        the Congress and the BJP have to be rejected so that an independent foreign 
        policy is charted out which is in tune with the country’s national interests.</font></p>

    <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Congress: Ignominious Record</font></strong><font color="#FFFFFF"></p> 
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The Congress-led UPA government has registered an ignominious 
      record. Betrayal of the people’s trust by nurturing corruption among those 
      who exercise power; pursuing policies which have resulted in perpetuating 
      price rise and high inflation; turning its back on the millions of farmers 
      who are unable to earn a decent livelihood; failure to take firm measures 
      to curb communal forces; compromising national sovereignty by allying with 
      the interests of the USA.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The Congress and the UPA have to be called to account for 
      its misdeeds and ousted from the government.</p>
    <p><strong>Combat Communalism</strong></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Various communal forces have been active in fomenting communal 
      tensions during the past five years. The aim of the Hindutva outfits is 
      to create and widen divisions between Hindus and Muslims. From 2009, communal 
      violence has occurred in Hyderabad, Nanded, Ahmedabad, Belgaum, Dhule, Bodoland 
      territory, Kishtwar, Nawada, Barielly, Kosi Kalan, Pratapgarh, Faizabad 
      and Muzzafarnagar. The list is endless. In Rajasthan, after the BJP lost 
      power in 2008, a series of communal incidents took place in the following 
      years. In Uttar Pradesh, after the Samajwadi Party government came to power 
      in 2011, a number of riots erupted. The Muzaffarnagar violence was the worst 
      in recent times. In most of these riots, there is the common pattern of 
      the involvement of the RSS and its outfits.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The attacks on religious minorities, both Muslims and Christians 
      grew in number and intensity under the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh 
      and Karnataka.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">In the year 2013, 828 communal incidents took place all 
      over the country in which 133 people died and 2269 were injured. The truth 
      is blunt and it cannot be ignored – such riots were manufactured to create 
      a communal polarization to make electoral gains in the 16<sup>th</sup> Lok 
      Sabha election. They are a warning to all secular democratic forces, that 
      communal politics needs to be firmly countered with political will and determination. 
      Only then can communal amity, people’s unity and progress be assured.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Terrorism</strong></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Terrorist attacks have continued to take place in different 
      parts of the country. The source of terrorism is religious extremism of 
      various varieties. While there are continuing instances of terrorist violence 
      involving some extremist elements from the Muslim community, it was extremist 
      Hindutva elements who were behind terrorist blasts in Malegaon, Mecca Masjid, 
      Ajmer Sharief and the Samjhauta Express. Ethnic chauvinist groups have indulged 
      in terrorist violence in the North East.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">There has to be a concerted campaign against the forces 
      of religious extremism, communalism and chauvinism from which terrorist 
      groups emanate. Firm measures have to be taken to preempt terrorist attacks 
      and track down the terrorist networks. But the bias and targeting of innocent 
      Muslim youth in the name of tackling terrorism should stop. Action should 
      be taken against the security and police authorities who have implicated 
      youth in false cases. The State should compensate those youth who were imprisoned 
      for long periods of time and acquitted by courts. The draconian provisions 
      of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act should be removed.</p>
