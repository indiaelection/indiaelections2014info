<strong>Communist Party of India (Marxist)</strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Manifesto for the </strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>16<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha Elections, 2014</strong></p><p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Part I </strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The people of India are going to the polls to elect the 16<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha. These elections are being held at a time when parliamentary democracy is under onslaught from various quarters. Increasingly democracy is being undermined by the power of big money in politics. Rampant corruption at the highest levels of government and public life is corroding the vitals of the democratic system. The neo-liberal policies pursued by the Congress-led government for a decade has denigrated parliament with policies being determined by a nexus of big business, foreign financial institutions and pliant ruling politicians and bureaucrats. The communal forces headed by the BJP-RSS combine are making a bid for power which poses a threat to the secular –democratic values of the Republic.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The people, who have always vitalized the parliamentary system with their deep faith and participation in the democratic system, have to act. They have to assert their rights. They should fight to bring about a change in the policies, for ending the corrupt rule, for strengthening democracy and secularism.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Dismal Record of UPA Government</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The two UPA governments have pursued neo-liberal economic policies which have led to a growing economic divide. This has resulted in pampering the rich and squeezing the people.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Effects on People’s Lives</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Despite the so-called high growth achieved under the UPA government’s earlier years, the lives of the ordinary people have not changed:</p><p align="JUSTIFY">36 per cent of women and 34 per cent of men are undernourished;</p><p align="JUSTIFY">About half (48 per cent) of children under the age of 5 are under nourished and malnourished.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">29 per cent of children drop out between class I and V and 46 per cent between class I and VIII.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">80 per cent rural and 64 per cent of all urban households consume less than the recommended calorie norm.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Eighty per cent of out-patients and sixty per cent of in-patients have to resort to private medical services as India has one of the most privatized systems of healthcare in the world. Eight crore people are pushed below the poverty line every year because of the exorbitant costs of private healthcare.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Workers: Losing Out</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Workers have been the main target of exploitation by the neo-liberal regime. The share of wages in net value added in the organized industrial sector is one of the lowest in the world. It was 30.36 per cent in 1981 and this came down to 10.6 per cent in 2007-08.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The growing contractualisation and casualisation of the work force is one of the main reasons for bringing down the share of wages enabling employers to increase their share of profits. The number of women workers have come down by nearly two crore during the period 2004-05 to 2001-12, as they cannot find work.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Non-payment of minimum wages, denial of equal wages and maternity benefits is rampant. The right to form trade unions is under attack as illustrated by the Maruti-Suzuki case. Both the Congress and the BJP governments in the states have a anti-working class record.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Farmers in Distress</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The peasantry have borne the brunt of first the NDA government’s policies and later of the UPA government’s policies. Corporatisation of agriculture, cuts in subsidies and public investment in agriculture and trade liberalization have caused distress to large sections of farmers. Between 1996 and 2012, rural India witnessed the appalling phenomenon of more than 2.90 lakh farmers suicides. Reversal of land reform laws and forcible acquisition of agricultural land has driven away many farmers from agriculture. Fifteen million cultivators have quit the occupation since 1991 upto 2011. Without breaking from the neo-liberal policies, the farmers of India cannot be assured of a decent livelihood and a secure future.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Agricultural Workers: Most Exploited</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The condition of agricultural workers has steadily deteriorated. Successive central governments have refused to bring in a comprehensive legislation for the fixation of wages and social security benefits for agricultural workers. Thus there is no statutorily fixed minimum wages for agricultural workers in many states. The number of work days per year is declining. In most states they have no house sites or houses. The plight of agricultural women workers is worse. They have lesser days of work and suffer the most as they have to feed the family in the face of rising prices.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Unbearable Price Rise</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The most striking failure of the Congress-led UPA government has been its total inability to check the unrelenting rise in the prices of food and other essential commodities. For seven long years since 2007, India has lived with persistent double digit food inflation. The Consumer Price Index inflation has mostly remained above 9 per cent per annum.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the last four years from December 2009 to 2013, prices of rice, wheat and groundnut oil increased between 50 to 100 per cent; prices of potatoes have doubled and even quadrupled during this five year period; onion prices have on an average doubled from already high levels.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The price rise is in fact a result of government policies. The decontrol of petrol and diesel prices have led to continuous increase raising the cost of transport fuelling price rise. Diesel prices have almost tripled in the two terms of the UPA, from Rs. 20 in January 2004 to Rs. 55 in December 2013 (Delhi prices).</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The people particularly the poor, have been ground down by the cruel and unrelenting price rise.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Curse of Unemployment</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Apart from curbing price rise, the growing unemployment is the second biggest failure of the UPA government. Between 2005 and 2010, the rate of employment growth has been less than 1 per cent annually. Whatever jobs have been created are the low paid, contractual and without social security. Of the 15-29 age group of young people who number 330 million (33 crore) the unemployment rate is 13.3 per cent. One in every three graduates in this age group is unemployed.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The so-called high growth years have resulted in jobless growth. Such a bankrupt growth path should be rejected.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Economic Policies: Transfer of Resources to the Rich</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Congress-led UPA government has provided a bonanza to the corporates and the richer sections. From 13 billionaires (with net assets of Rs. 5,000 crore and above) in 2003, by 2012 there were 122 such billionaires. Between 2009 and 2013 a massive Rs. 21 lakh crores of central government tax revenues were given away as taxes forgone or in tax concessions. The government has resorted to massive disinvestment selling more than Rs. 91,000 crores worth of shares of public sector units between 2009 and 2013. The government has allowed the loot of natural resources of the country whether it be land, minerals, gas or spectrum. Windfall profits have been made by big business houses and private companies through this plunder.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">What the government has undertaken is a massive transfer of the resources of the people and the country into the hands of a few.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The government did not take measures to tap the tax potential – either by raising effective rates or cracking down on massive evasion of taxes by the wealthy. Tax-GDP ratio has remained lower than they were in 2007-08. Instead of raising resources, the curbing of government expenditure became a priority. There have been cuts in expenditure bearing on the lives of people such as on agriculture and rural development (which includes MNREGA); health and education. Fertilizer, food and petroleum subsidies have been cut down. Subsidies on food and fuel were cut by Rs. 78,000 crore in the last three years.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The entry of Foreign Capital (FDI and FIIs) has been allowed in all spheres. FDI caps have been enhanced in the banking, infrastructure, real estate, defence production and agri-business. The FDI in multi-brand retail is a graphic example of how the interests of Walmart and other foreign supermarket chains supersede the livelihood and employment of 4 crore (40 million) people in retail trade in India. To start with this executive decision has to be scrapped and FDI policy governed by the interests of national sovereignty, priorities of national development and the employment needs of the people.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Faced with an economic slowdown the UPA government seeks to woo foreign capital by giving more concessions and providing big business with further tax cuts and incentives. What is required is massive public investment in rural development, agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors. This would create demand and new jobs. But given its class bias, the government has refused to undertake this.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The pursuit of the neo-liberal policies by the six-year BJP-led government and the ten year Congress-led government, need to be reversed. What is required are alternative economic policies in the interests of the people and the country.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Food Security</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">India ranks 94<sup>th</sup> out of 199 countries in the Global Hunger Index. The shame of chronic hunger and deprivation of food constitutes a damning indictment of the polices pursued by the UPA government and the earlier NDA regime. Both have steadfastly refused to introduce a universal public distribution system as it goes against the World Bank and market prescriptions. The Food Security law enacted by parliament is cited as a major step towards food security. This is not true. It continues with a targeted system. It provides for only 5 kg per individual per month. In urban areas 50 per cent of the people are excluded. The CPI(M) and the Left have consistently fought for a universal public Distribution System. We need to provide a minimum of 35 kg of foodgrains to all families at not more than Rs. 2 per kg. The citizen’s basic right to food has to be ensured.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Corruption &amp; Mega Scams</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The last one decade of UPA rule has set an unprecedented record for corruption with one mega scam after the other from the 2G spectrum to the coal allocation and the KG basin gas pricing. The government’s neo-liberal policies has spawned a nexus of big business-ruling politician-bureaucrats.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">CAG has estimated that the 2G telecom has cost the exchequer Rs. 1.76 lakh crore while the coal scam around Rs. 1.86 lakh crore. The KG basin gas deal and the earlier concessions to Reliance for increased gas price had led to a loss of around Rs. 100,000 crore to the government. The current revision proposed by the government, is twice this amount. The Commonwealth Games scam was worth around Rs. 60,000 crore.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Contrary to the claim that privatization and free market reduce corruption, evidence shows that the “black economy” and the propagation of corruption has expanded under such policies, and is now almost 50 per cent of the GDP of the country. (Global Financial Integrity, 2010)</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Resources that belong to the people are being looted through a range of corrupt practices. Illegal flows to tax havens and offshore accounts have grown rapidly along with black money; the post-reform annual flows are five times the pre-reform flows. The total accumulated capital and assets held by Indians abroad is estimated to be in the range of half a trillion dollars (Rs. 25 lakh crore) to 1.4 trillion dollars (Rs. 70 lakh crores).</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The outrage among the people and the protest against corruption finally compelled the UPA government to bring an amended Lokpal legislation which was adopted in parliament. However, the Lokpal Act needs to bring within its purview the PPP projects and the contracts given out to corporates involving public funds. More importantly, the big business-politician-bureaucrat nexus spawned by the neo-liberal regime needs to be broken. The CPI(M) calls for the reversal of the neo-liberal policies which have spawned such a nexus.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Foreign Policy: Tilt to the US</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The decade long UPA government has shifted the course of foreign policy towards a pro-US orientation. In the first term, it surrendered the independent basis of foreign policy by entering into a strategic alliance with the United States of America, military cooperation and signing the Indo-US nuclear deal. The consequence of these steps have unfolded in its second term.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">India acted against its own interests by curtailing its relations with Iran. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline was scuttled at the behest of America. India drastically cut down oil imports from Iran to conform to the illegal US sanctions. India adopted an ambivalent stand on Syria and refused to condemn the Western backed forces to instigate a civil war and destabilize the Syrian government. India has strengthened its military and security ties with Israel and consequently downgraded its support to the Palestinian cause. The UPA government has joined a India-Japan-US trilateral security relationship – a US sponsored move to counter China.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">India has not utilised its weight in the BRICS, IBSA and the multilateral forms to strengthen South-South cooperation and multipolarity.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The foreign policy stance of both the Congress and the BJP have to be rejected so that an independent foreign policy is charted out which is in tune with the country’s national interests.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Congress: Ignominious Record</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Congress-led UPA government has registered an ignominious record. Betrayal of the people’s trust by nurturing corruption among those who exercise power; pursuing policies which have resulted in perpetuating price rise and high inflation; turning its back on the millions of farmers who are unable to earn a decent livelihood; failure to take firm measures to curb communal forces; compromising national sovereignty by allying with the interests of the USA.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Congress and the UPA have to be called to account for its misdeeds and ousted from the government.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Combat Communalism</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Various communal forces have been active in fomenting communal tensions during the past five years. The aim of the Hindutva outfits is to create and widen divisions between Hindus and Muslims. From 2009, communal violence has occurred in Hyderabad, Nanded, Ahmedabad, Belgaum, Dhule, Bodoland territory, Kishtwar, Nawada, Barielly, Kosi Kalan, Pratapgarh, Faizabad and Muzzafarnagar. The list is endless. In Rajasthan, after the BJP lost power in 2008, a series of communal incidents took place in the following years. In Uttar Pradesh, after the Samajwadi Party government came to power in 2011, a number of riots erupted. The Muzaffarnagar violence was the worst in recent times. In most of these riots, there is the common pattern of the involvement of the RSS and its outfits.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The attacks on religious minorities, both Muslims and Christians grew in number and intensity under the BJP governments in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">In the year 2013, 828 communal incidents took place all over the country in which 133 people died and 2269 were injured. The truth is blunt and it cannot be ignored – such riots were manufactured to create a communal polarization to make electoral gains in the 16<sup>th</sup> Lok Sabha election. They are a warning to all secular democratic forces, that communal politics needs to be firmly countered with political will and determination. Only then can communal amity, people’s unity and progress be assured.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Terrorism</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Terrorist attacks have continued to take place in different parts of the country. The source of terrorism is religious extremism of various varieties. While there are continuing instances of terrorist violence involving some extremist elements from the Muslim community, it was extremist Hindutva elements who were behind terrorist blasts in Malegaon, Mecca Masjid, Ajmer Sharief and the Samjhauta Express. Ethnic chauvinist groups have indulged in terrorist violence in the North East.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">There has to be a concerted campaign against the forces of religious extremism, communalism and chauvinism from which terrorist groups emanate. Firm measures have to be taken to preempt terrorist attacks and track down the terrorist networks. But the bias and targeting of innocent Muslim youth in the name of tackling terrorism should stop. Action should be taken against the security and police authorities who have implicated youth in false cases. The State should compensate those youth who were imprisoned for long periods of time and acquitted by courts. The draconian provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act should be removed.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Curb Divisive Forces</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The country has witnessed forces of regional chauvinism, narrow parochial interests and ethnic and caste tensions rising in different parts. Attacks on North Indians in Mumbai and Maharashtra by the MNS and the Shiv Sena; the demand that outsiders leave the state affected the lives of many Indian citizens. People from the North-East were subjected to hate mail and threats causing them to flee from certain centres in South India. Recently there have been racist attacks against people from the North-East in the capital city of Delhi. In the North East, extremists have targeted poor Hindi-speaking workers and killed them. These divisive and reactionary attacks should be firmly put down. The organisations and leaders behind such attacks should be prosecuted. The right of Indian citizens to reside, study or work in any part of India should be firmly protected.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Violence on Women</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The period since the last Lok Sabha election has been one of unremitting and alarming rise in the crimes against women. This has become a major national issue. Rapes and gang rapes of women and young girls are taking place all around the country. Sexual assaults and violence against young girls and children are particularly horrific. The Nirbhaya case in Delhi led to the appointment of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee which submitted a comprehensive report with well considered recommendations to bring about changes in the laws concerning violence against women. As a result the Criminal Law Amendment Act was passed by Parliament which provides for more stringent punishment for gang rape, child rape and other sexual offences. But it has fallen short of the holistic recommendations made by the Verma Committee.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The struggle against violence against women must occupy a central place in the political and social spheres. It is not enough to pass laws, there has to be the political will on the part of the central and state governments to firmly tackle crimes against women. It is shocking that in a state like West Bengal there has been an alarming increase in the number of crimes against women in the last three years. This indicates the importance of the state machinery tackling the problem seriously and with determination.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>SCs and STs</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">Neoliberal policies have accentuated the social oppression, caste discrimination and violence against adivasis and dalits. There has been a 18 per cent increase in the registered cases of violence against dalits between the years 2010 and 2012. Untouchability practices still continue. Not only have the number of reserved jobs for SC and STs available in the Government and public sector suffered a drastic reduction because of abolition of posts, ban on recruitments and privatization of many services, the Government has failed to introduce reservation in the private sector. The plunder of natural resources and takeover of adivasi inhabited land and violation of the protections under Fifth Schedule and PESAA have had a drastic impact on the lives and livelihoods of adivasis.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Minorities</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The tokenist implementation of the Sachar Commission recommendations have resulted in continuing discrimination against Muslim communities in major spheres. The Government diluted the recommendations of the Ranganath Mishra Commission concerning 10 per cent reservation for Muslims in jobs. In addition the targeting of innocent Muslim youth and their incarceration as undertrials for years together. This has led to a widespread feeling of insecurity in the community.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>BJP: A Retrograde Divisive Force</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Bharatiya Janata Party offers no alternative to the Congress. In fact it is an ardent adherent of neo-liberal policies. There is no difference in the outlook of the BJP as far as economic policies are concerned. It is a pro-big business rightwing party which is based on the Hindutva ideology.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The BJP and its progenitor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh espouse an ideology which is inimical to the vision of a modern secular State. Hindu majoritarian platform is the main source of communal politics and communal violence. It is this majority communalism which feeds into minority communalism and threatens the unity of the people.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Narendra Modi who is projected as the Prime Ministerial candidate and the Gujarat model that is touted by the BJP represents a dangerous mix of patronage for the big business and corporates combined with rabid communalism.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Gujarat model is based on largesse for corporates. It is marked by lowest wage scale of workers and poor social indicators such as high malnourishment, high maternal and infant mortality.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The BJP is steeped in high level corruption. The origins of many of the mega scams like the telecom and coal block allocations began in the period of the NDA government. The notorious BJP government headed by Yeddyurappa in Karnataka perpetrated the mining scandal with the mining mafia itself being part of the government. Minister after minister in the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh was indicted by the Lokayuta on corruption charges. The BJP’s record in privatization and allowing the loot of natural resources matches that of the Congress.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The BJP has a shameful legacy of letting communal politics run amok. The 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid, the 2002 horrific violence in Gujarat and the recent Muzaffarnagar riots are testimony to this dark record.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Hindutva ideology is intrinsically based on <em>Varnashrama</em> <em>Dharma </em>and socially conservative and regressive. It is not an accident that the highest number of atrocities on scheduled castes and tribes take place in states where the BJP rules or is strong as in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">However much the BJP may present its model of development and good governance, the reality is that its model is a reactionary and retrograde one.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Alternative Policies Put out by the Left</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The country needs to be rescued from the politics and policies of the Congress and the BJP. What is required are alternative policies in the realm of the economic, social and political. The CPI(M) and the left parties have set out such an alternative. These alternative policies have the following major components:</p><p align="JUSTIFY">(i) Defence of secularism and national unity (ii) for a democratic transformation of agrarian relations and land reforms; ensuring remunerative prices for farmers; (iii) for a self-reliant economic system and path of development which will develop the productive forces, maximise employment and reduce economic and social disparities; (iv) for a democratic and federal political system with necessary Constitutional changes; (v) defence of the rights of the working people, their minimum livelihood and social security; (vi) planned development and balanced growth; (vii) social justice, end to caste discrimination and protection of rights of women, dalits, minorities and tribal people; (viii) firm measures to curb corruption; judicial and electoral reforms; (ix) adopt non-aligned, independent foreign policy.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">These alternative policies are spelt out in full in Part II of this Manifesto.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The Left-led governments at various times in Kerala, for 34 years in West Bengal and the seven Left Front governments in Tripura have shown some facets of the alternative policies that can be pursued. They include effective implementation of land reforms; decentralization of powers to the panchayat system; expansion of the public distribution system; protecting the livelihood of farmers and workers; maintenance of communal harmony and secularism.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Role of the CPI(M)</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) has been a consistent fighter against the neo-liberal policies, against communalism and the pro-imperialist approach of the ruling class parties.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) has stood firmly with the working people of the country. It has fought for the rights of the working class, peasants, agricultural workers, artisans and employees both in the organized and unorganized sector.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) has been the democratic champion of the rights of the rights of the dalits, adivasis, women, minorities and the backward classes.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) will fight for alternative policies in parliament and voice the demands of the different sections of the working people.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) and the Left parties will cooperate with other secular non-Congress parties to ensure that there is an alternative before the people as against the Congress and the BJP.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">We appeal to the people to reject the Congress and the UPA.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">Defeat the BJP and its allies and prevent them from coming to power.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>Strengthen the CPI(M) and Left: </strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>For an Alternative</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">We appeal to the people to support and vote for the CPI(M). A strong CPI(M) and Left presence in the Lok Sabha will be the basis for strengthening the secular-democratic foundations and for pro-people alternative policies.</p><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Reject Congress, Defeat BJP</strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Vote for the CPI(M)</strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Strengthen the Left</strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>For a Secular and Democratic Alternative</strong></p><p align="CENTER"><strong>PART II</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>FOR ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES</strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><strong><em>Alternative Trajectory of Growth</em> </strong></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI(M) will work for economic policies that</p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Integrate growth with employment generation towards creating full employment and money in the hands of the people to boost demand</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Enlarge the resource base by taxing the rich, corporate profits, crackdown on tax evaders, black money, money laundering, higher taxes on luxury goods, thereby generating resources for growth</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Increase public investments in agricultural production and research.</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Allocate resources for providing physical and social infrastructure – electricity, public transport, ports, schools, colleges, and public hospitals</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Favour the production of goods for mass consumption and not unsustainable luxury goods</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Public provisioning and subsidies for inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, electricity/diesel</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Provide incentives for research and development and special initiatives to increase competitiveness of small and medium enterprises that provide much greater employment</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Increase annual plan Expenditure amounting to 10% of India’s current GDP</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Scrapping the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act and setting a minimum floor for social sector spending as a binding constraint in fiscal exercise for both centre and state governments.</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Re-imposing controls on the outflow and inflow of finance capital</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Halt any further dilution of Government equity in public sector banks and strengthen the public sector in banking and insurance with strict adherence to priority sector lending norms.</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">All regulatory authorities of the financial sector should be accountable to Parliament and legislative oversight.</p></li></ul><p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Resource mobilization </strong></em></p><p align="JUSTIFY">The CPI (M) will</p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Tax speculative capital gains by restoring Long-Term Capital Gains Tax and increasing Securities Transaction Tax</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Launch a drive to unearth black money, especially those stashed in Swiss banks and other offshore tax havens</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Increase wealth tax for the super rich and introduce inheritance tax</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Plug the Mauritius route by reviewing Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Mauritius and other countries</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Corporate profit tax should be increased by increasing statutory rates so that effective tax rates are not low causing huge loss of revenue</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Taxation of capital gains from the international transfer of shares in foreign company with underlying assets in India</p></li><li><p align="JUSTIFY">GST to be implemented only after ensuring a higher rate for the states so as to at least partially correct the present fiscal imbalance</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="JUSTIFY"><em><strong>Financial Sector Regulation </strong></em></p><p align="JUSTIFY">In order to maintain predominant state control over finance and revival of development finance, the CPI (M) stands for:</p><ul><li><p align="JUSTIFY">Reversing moves towards Full Capital Account Convertibility (Tarapore Committee recommendations);
